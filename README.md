**ABSTRACT** This project focuses on the creation of a pipeline inspection robot to deal with the pipeline inspection
problem. The project utilizes the concept of non-destructive evaluation, which can achieve the function that without
the need to damage the pipelines, the robot can be sent into the pipeline to execute the specific assignment given by
human. The circuits are designed to control the robot's movements within the pipes. The robot is equipped with
functions such as forward and backward movement, inspection of pipeline issues, and providing feedback on
detected problems. Additionally, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is designed to diagram for the robot and the
corresponding Verilog code is implemented. Besides, simulation tests using two sets of predefined data are
conducted and the waveforms are generated to compare the detection results.

This project initially started from _ECE230 (Digital Logic Fundamental)_ as a class project, later I expanded the result and further research, and now the result has been published on SSRN.
